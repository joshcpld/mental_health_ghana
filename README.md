This repository contains the code and output used to write my capstone research project for Econometrics 2 as part of my Master of Applied Econometrics at the University of Melbourne. It seeks to quantify the impact of water insecurity in Ghana with an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach, using a World Bank survey of Ghanian households in 2009-10 (available here: https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2534).

For completing this project, I and my group members were awarded runner-up of the Outstanding Capstone Research Project in Economics at the University of Melbourne in 2024. This report was chosen amongst the 150+ groups which submitted capstone research projects throughout the year.

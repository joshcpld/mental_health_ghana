Tables used for the progress report:

- Psychology (S10AI)
- Housing: water (S12AI)
- Household background information (S1D)
- Key household information (key_hhld_info)

In order to derive the following variables:

- Binary variable indicating mental health status (1 = likely to have a mental health disorder) (S10AI)
- Binary variable indicating access to basic drinking water services (1 = has access) (S1D)
- Age (S10AI)
- Binary variable indicating sex (1 = female) (S10AI)

### Importing the housing table

<br>

We are importing this table to create a dummy variable for access to basic drinking services.

<br>

UNICEF defines a household's access to water as "basic" if it satisfies the following conditions:

 - It's delivered from one of the following sources: piped water, boreholes, tubewells, protected dug well, protected springs, rainwater and packaged of delivered water.
 
 - A round trip to collect water does not exceed 30 minutes.
 
 
 <br>
 
 UNICEF actually has different definitions for water access, where we want to capture dummies for them as one of our extensions. They are defined as:
 
 - Safely managed: Drinking water from an improved water souce which is located on premises, available when needed and free of faecal and priority contamination.
 
 - Basic: as defined above.
 
 - No services: drinking water collected directly fro ma river, dam, lake, pond, stream, canal or irrigation channel.

  #Editing the drinking_source_distance cells to make them all the same scale: kilometres.
    
  mutate(drinking_source_distance_length = case_when(
    
    distance_unit == 0 ~ 0,  # In house
    distance_unit == 1 ~ as.numeric(drinking_source_distance_length) * 0.0009144,  # Yards to kilometers

    distance_unit == 3 ~ as.numeric(drinking_source_distance_length),  # Already in kilometers

  ))

```

The charts above shows us that there is a lot of missing values for the distance variables in both length and mins. This likely have something todo with the drinking source of each household. I need to collect all the NA data together in order to diagnose the problem.

The charts below show us that:

 - Most of the problem is in 1 and 2, which correspond to plumbing in the house. We can change their distances to zero.
 
 - 8 is also a clear problem, which is bottled water. We think its reasonable to assume this botteld water is available at the house, so can change this distance to zero as well.
 
- 9 and 10 are protected wells and boreholes. Without more information about how far away they are (unavailable) we need to leave these as NAs.

``` {r importing_iii}

# Extracting and charting NA data

na_data <- s12ai %>% 
  filter(is.na(drinking_source_distance_length)) %>% 
  group_by(drinking_source) %>%

ggplot(na_data, aes(x = drinking_source, y = na_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 14))




# Now I have diagnosed the problem, I need to make the necessary changes to the dataframe such that dirnking_sources with values 1 and 2 have a distance of zero in both length and minutes. All other NAs remain given data limitations.

s12ai <- s12ai %>% 
  mutate(drinking_source_distance_length = case_when(
    
    is.na(distance_unit) & drinking_source %in% c(1, 2, 8) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ drinking_source_distance_length
  )) %>% 
  
  mutate(drinking_source_distance_mins = case_when(
        is.na(distance_unit) & drinking_source %in% c(1, 2, 8) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ drinking_source_distance_mins
  ))



# Repeating the NA value analysis/chart below, the scale are now sufficiently small to continue/we don't have any other information that could help reduce the incidence of NAs.

na_data <- s12ai %>% 
  filter(is.na(drinking_source_distance_length)) %>% 
  group_by(drinking_source) %>% 
  summarise(na_count = n())

ggplot(na_data, aes(x = drinking_source, y = na_count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 14))

gg_miss_var(s12ai)


# Because we can't deal with the remaining NAs, we exclude them from our analysis. However, we only exclude where NAs appear in the drinking_source_distance_length and drinking_source_distance_mins  variables.

s12ai <- s12ai %>%

Household data is not provided at the individual level. Therefore, we need to append it to our psychological data.

Doing a quick NA visualisation I can see that there are a few columns with NA values. Given how small they are as proportions, I omit the NA values for depression and drinking_source_distance. I don't both with distance_unit (its only use was to help us clean the data earlier.)

# Robustness checks

## Changing definitions of water access

Ultimately, our chosen definition of water access has been chosen arbitrarily from UNICEF's taxonomy of access. If our results are robust, the size of our estimators should decrease as we move from the lowest ("no service") to highest ("safely managed") level of water access. The better the access, the greater an impact it should have on reducing the incidence of mental health issues.
